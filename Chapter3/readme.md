## Using edge impulse and arduino nano to control leds with voice commands

This chapter will demosntrate  the usage of **keyword spotting (KWS)** through Edge Impulse by building an application to voice control a led.

This chapter will begin with dataset preparation, showing you how to acquire audio data with a mobile phone and the built-in microphone on Arduino Nano. Then, we will design a model based on the popular **Mel-filterbank energy(MFE)** features for speech recognition. In these recipes,we will show to extract
